# MusicToLED

Syncing an analog LED strip to music using Arduino. Ft Fourier Transform.

I'm using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm to retrieve the sound frequencies and map them into the LED strip color and intensity. The final result is we get the LED strip to sync (/react) to music, resulting in beautiful colors that match the different pitches and volume of the music playing.
